# Geocoding

This is code to run the process of converting addresses into location(latitude , longitude) based platform .

## Description
Geocoding is the process of converting a human-readable address or location description (such as a street address, city name, or landmark) into geographic coordinates (such as latitude and longitude). This allows the address or location to be accurately plotted on a map or used in a geographic information system (GIS). Geocoding is typically performed by software programs called geocoders, which use a combination of reference data, algorithms, and heuristics to match the input address or location description to a specific geographic location. The reference data used by geocoders can include street maps, address databases, and satellite imagery, among others.

Geocoding is used in a variety of applications, such as mapping and navigation software, emergency services, and location-based advertising. It is also an important tool for urban planners, environmental scientists, and other professionals who need to analyze and visualize spatial data.

This code is written in Python and uses the Pandas and Geopy libraries to read an input CSV file containing addresses, geocode the addresses to obtain latitude and longitude coordinates, and then save the results to a new output CSV file.
## Prerequisites
Before running this code you need to be installed `pandas` and `geop`' library . If note installed don't panic I will give you instruction for installing and executing of code so that you can use as per your project. 

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

## Installation and Usage
First we need to install `pandas` and `geopy` library

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install `panda`s and `geopy`.

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install geopy
```
The first line imports the `pandas` library, which provides data structures and tools for data analysis.
```bash
import pandas as pd
```
Then imports the `Nominatim` geocoder class from the Geopy library, which provides a way to geocode addresses and obtain their latitude and longitude coordinates
```bash
from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim
```
Then input CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame using the ``read_csv()`` method. The path to the input CSV file is specified using the 'r' prefix to indicate that it is a raw string and the backslashes should be interpreted literally. You can change path as per your file location
```bash
df = pd.read_csv(r'C:/Users/user/Desktop/csv_files/Book1.csv')
```
After raeding the csv file, initializes a `Nominatim` geocoder object with a user agent string and a timeout of 10 seconds. The user agent string is a unique identifier that allows the geocoder service to track usage and prevent abuse
```bash
geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent='my_app', timeout=10)
```
Then defines a new function called `get_location()` that takes an address as input and returns a tuple of the latitude and longitude coordinates. The function uses the `geocode()` method of the geocoder to obtain the location object for the address. If the location object is None, indicating that the address could not be geocoded, the function returns None for both latitude and longitude. Otherwise, it returns the latitude and longitude values of the location object
```bash
def get_location(address):
    location = geolocator.geocode(address)
    if location is None:
        return None, None
    else:
        return location.latitude, location.longitude
```
After applying the function it uses the `apply()` method of the DataFrame to apply the `get_location()` function to the `address` column of the DataFrame. The `zip()` function is used to unpack the tuple of latitude and longitude values returned by `get_location()` into separate `latitude` and `longitude` columns in the DataFrame
```bash
df['latitude'], df['longitude'] = zip(*df['address'].apply(get_location))
```
Last it saves the output DataFrame to a new CSV file using the `to_csv()` method of Pandas. The path to the output CSV file is specified using the 'r' prefix to indicate that it is a raw string and the backslashes should be interpreted literally. The index parameter is set to False to exclude the index column from the output CSV file, you can change as per your desire location
```bash
df.to_csv(r'C:/Users/user/Desktop/csv_files/test12.csv', index=False)
```



## Usage

Geocoding has a wide range of applications in various fields of real life. Here are some examples:

1. Navigation and mapping: Geocoding is used extensively in mapping and navigation applications like Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze. It helps users to find directions, locate addresses, and get real-time traffic updates.

2. Business and marketing: Geocoding is used by businesses to target specific locations for their marketing campaigns. It helps businesses to identify potential customers, analyze market trends, and make informed decisions about their marketing strategies.

3. Emergency services: Geocoding is used by emergency services like police, fire departments, and ambulance services to locate people in distress quickly. It enables emergency services to respond to calls more efficiently and reduce response times.

4. Environmental monitoring: Geocoding is used by environmental scientists to monitor environmental changes and predict potential natural disasters. It helps in analyzing and visualizing data to identify patterns and trends.

5. Urban planning: Geocoding is used by urban planners to analyze and plan the development of cities and towns. It enables them to identify potential areas for development, analyze land use patterns, and plan transportation systems.

6. Real estate: Geocoding is used by real estate agents to locate properties and help buyers find homes in specific locations. It enables them to identify potential properties, analyze market trends, and make informed decisions about real estate investments.

Overall, geocoding plays a crucial role in various fields of real life, enabling individuals and organizations to make informed decisions based on spatial data analysis
